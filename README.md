# Fourier Series

This takes an svg of one path (M, m, L, l, C, c, Q, and q commands) and draws it using a fourier series. I'm not sure how any of the math works, that was Leo's job.

There's a few drawings I added, but adding more is as simple as drawing a path on inkscape and saving as an svg.

Try these drawings:
 - [Harry Styles](https://erickugel.github.io/Fourier-Series/?svg=harry)
 - [Teapot](https://erickugel.github.io/Fourier-Series/?svg=teapot)
 - [Rick Astley](https://erickugel.github.io/Fourier-Series/?svg=astley)
 - [Hand](https://erickugel.github.io/Fourier-Series/?svg=hand)

You can specify a drawing with the svg url parameter. And there's a 404 drawing as well!
